"""
This is the base class for all models that support future prediction, i.e., zero-shot prediction.

It extends the ContinualModel class and adds the future_forward method, which should be implemented by all models that inherit from this class.
Such a method should take an input tensor and return a tensor representing the future prediction. This method is used by the future prediction evaluation protocol.

The change_transform method is used to update the transformation applied to the input data. This is useful when the model is trained on a dataset and then evaluated on a different dataset. In this case, the transformation should be updated to match the new dataset.
