# ü¶£ Mammoth - A PyTorch Framework for Benchmarking Continual Learning

_Mammoth_ is built to streamline the development and benchmark of continual learning research. With **more than 70 methods and 20 datasets**, it includes the most complete list competitors and benchmarks for research purposes.

The core idea of Mammoth is that it is designed to be modular, easy to extend, and - most importantly - _easy to debug_.

With Mammoth, nothing is set in stone. You can easily add new models, datasets, training strategies, or functionalities.

</p>

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup

- üì• Install with `pip install -r requirements.txt` or run it directly with `uv run python main.py ...`
  > **Note**: PyTorch version >= 2.1.0 is required for scaled_dot_product_attention. If you cannot support this requirement, uncomment the lines 136-139 under `scaled_dot_product_attention` in `backbone/vit.py`.
- üöÄ Use `main.py` or `./utils/main.py` to run experiments.
- üß© New models can be added to the `models/` folder.
- üìä New datasets can be added to the `datasets/` folder.

## üß™ Examples

### Run a model

The following command will run the model `derpp` on the dataset `seq-cifar100` with a buffer of 500 samples the some random hyperparameters for _lr_, _alpha_, and _beta_:
```bash
python main.py --model derpp --dataset seq-cifar100 --alpha 0.5 --beta 0.5 --lr 0.001 --buffer_size 500
```

To run the model with the best hyperparameters, use the `--model_config=best` argument:
```bash
python main.py --model derpp --dataset seq-cifar100 --model_config best
```

 > NOTE: the `--model_config` argument will look for a file `<model_name>.yaml` in the `models/configs/` folder. This file should contain the hyperparameters for the best configuration of the model. You can find more information in [the documentation](https://aimagelab.github.io/mammoth/models/model_arguments.html#model-configurations-and-best-arguments).

### Build a new model

See the [documentation](https://aimagelab.github.io/mammoth/models/build_a_model.html) for a detailed guide on how to create a new model.

### Build a new dataset

See the [documentation](https://aimagelab.github.io/mammoth/datasets/build_a_dataset.html) for a detailed guide on how to create a new dataset.


## üÜï New Features

- `--loadcheck` option now can load the arguments saved from the checkpoint, so you can resume the training from the last checkpoint by just running `python main.py --loadcheck <checkpoint_name>`.
- The training now captures the SIGINT signal (Ctrl+C) to gracefully stop the training process and save the current state. The checkpoint is saved in `checkpoints/paused/` directory. This can be disabled by setting `--save_after_interrupt=0` in the command line.
- Add the option `--checkpoint_path` to specify a custom path for saving checkpoints. By default, checkpoints are saved in the `checkpoints/` directory.
- Now Mammoth can be installed with pip to be used as a library. You can install it with `pip install -e .` (or just `uv sync`) and then import it in your Python scripts. Examples of usage can be found in the `examples/` directory.

  NOTE: Mammoth is not yet available on PyPI, so you need to clone the repository and run the command above to install it.

## üó∫Ô∏è Update Roadmap

All the code is under active development. Here are some of the features we are working on:

- üß† **New models**: We are continuously working on adding new models to the repository.
- üîÑ **New training modalities**: New training regimes, such a *regression*, *segmentation*, *detection*, etc.
- üìä **Openly accessible result dashboard**: The ideal would be a dashboard to visualize the results of all the models in both their respective settings (to prove their reproducibility) and in a general setting (to compare them). *This may take some time, since compute is not free.*

All the new additions will try to preserve the current structure of the repository, making it easy to add new functionalities with a simple merge.

## üß† Models

Mammoth currently supports **more than 70** models, with new releases covering the main competitors in literature.

## üî¨ On the reproducibility of Mammoth
We take great pride and care in the reproducibility of the models in Mammoth and we are commited to provide the community with the most accurate results possible. To this end, we provide a _REPRODUCIBILITY.md_ file in the repository that contains the results of the models in Mammoth.

The performance of each model is evaluated on the same dataset used in the paper and we report in _REPRODUCIBILITY.md_ the list of models that have been verified. We also provide the exact command used to train the model (most times, it follows `python main.py --model <model-name> --dataset <dataset-name> --model_config best`).

We encourage the community to report any issues with the reproducibility of the models in Mammoth. If you find any issues, please open an issue in the GitHub repository or contact us directly.

**Disclaimer**: Since there are many models in Mammoth (and some of them predate PyTorch), the process of filling the _REPRODUCIBILITY.md_ file is ongoing. We are working hard to fill the file with the results of all models in Mammoth. If you need the results of a specific model, please open an issue in the GitHub repository or contact us directly.

> Does this mean that the models that are not in the _REPRODUCIBILITY.md_ file do not reproduce?

No! It means that we have not yet found the appropriate dataset and hyperparameters to fill the file with the results of that model. We are working hard to fill the file with the results of all models in Mammoth. If you need the results of a specific model, please open an issue in the GitHub repository or contact us directly.
